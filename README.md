# Aphrodite: Inline Styles that work

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/aphrodite.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/aphrodite) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Khan/aphrodite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Khan/aphrodite) [![Gitter chat](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/Khan/aphrodite.svg)](https://gitter.im/Khan/aphrodite)

Support for colocating your styles with your JavaScript component.

- Works great with and without React
- Supports media queries without window.matchMedia
- Supports pseudo-selectors like `:hover`, `:active`, etc. without needing to
  store hover or active state in components. `:visited` works just fine too.
- Supports automatic global `@font-face` detection and insertion.
- Respects precedence order when specifying multiple styles
- Requires no AST transform (though you can have one to replace
  `StyleSheet.create` with a pre-computed value at compile time if you'd like).
- Injects only the exact styles needed for the render into the DOM.
- Can be used for server rendering.
- Few dependencies, small (20k, 6k gzipped)
- No external CSS file generated for inclusion
- Autoprefixes styles

# Installation

Aphrodite is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
npm install --save aphrodite
```

# API

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, css } from 'aphrodite';

class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return <div>
            <span className={css(styles.red)}>
                This is red.
            </span>
            <span className={css(styles.hover)}>
                This turns red on hover.
            </span>
            <span className={css(styles.small)}>
                This turns red when the browser is less than 600px width.
            </span>
            <span className={css(styles.red, styles.blue)}>
                This is blue.
            </span>
            <span className={css(styles.blue, styles.small)}>
                This is blue and turns red when the browser is less than
                600px width.
            </span>
        </div>;
    }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    red: {
        backgroundColor: 'red'
    },

    blue: {
        backgroundColor: 'blue'
    },

    hover: {
        ':hover': {
            backgroundColor: 'red'
        }
    },

    small: {
        '@media (max-width: 600px)': {
            backgroundColor: 'red',
        }
    }
});
```

# Use without React

Aphrodite was built with React in mind, but does not depend on React. Here, you can see it
used with [Web Components][webcomponents]:

```js
import { StyleSheet, css } from 'aphrodite';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    red: {
        backgroundColor: 'red'
    }
});

class App extends HTMLElement {
    attachedCallback() {
        this.innerHTML = `
            <div class="${css(styles.red)}">
                This is red.
            </div>
        `;
    }
}

document.registerElement('my-app', App);
```

# Style injection and buffering

Aphrodite will automatically attempt to create a `<style>` tag in the document's `<head>` element to put its generated styles in. Aphrodite will only generate one `<style>` tag and will add new styles to this over time. If you want to control which style tag Aphrodite uses, create a style tag yourself with the `data-aphrodite` attribute and Aphrodite will use that instead of creating one for you.

To speed up injection of styles, Aphrodite will automatically try to buffer writes to this `<style>` tag so that minimum number of DOM modifications happen.

# Server-side rendering

To perform server-side rendering, make a call to `StyleSheetServer.renderStatic`, which takes a callback. Do your rendering inside of the callback and return the generated HTML. All of the calls to `css()` inside of the callback will be collected and the generated css as well as the generated HTML will be returned.

To perform rehydration, call `StyleSheet.rehydrate` with the list of generated class names returned to you by `StyleSheetServer.renderStatic`.

As an example:

```js
import { StyleSheetServer } from 'aphrodite';

// Contains the generated html, as well as the generated css and some
// rehydration data.
var {html, css} = StyleSheetServer.renderStatic(() => {
    return ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App/>);
});

// Return the base HTML, which contains your rendered HTML as well as a
// simple rehydration script.
return `
    <html>
        <head>
            <style data-aphrodite>${css.content}</style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id='root'>${html}</div>
            <script src="./bundle.js"></script>
            <script>
                StyleSheet.rehydrate(${JSON.stringify(css.renderedClassNames)});
                ReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.getElementById('root'));
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>
`;
```

# Font Faces

Creating custom font faces is a special case. Typically you need to define a global `@font-face` rule. In the case of aphrodite we only want to insert that rule if it's actually being referenced by a class that's in the page. We've made it so that the `fontFamily` property can accept a font-face object (either directly or inside an array). A global `@font-face` rule is then generated based on the font definition.

```js
const coolFont = {
    fontFamily: "CoolFont",
    fontStyle: "normal",
    fontWeight: "normal",
    src: "url('coolfont.woff2') format('woff2')"
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    headingText: {
        fontFamily: coolFont,
        fontSize: 20
    },
    bodyText: {
        fontFamily: [coolFont, "sans-serif"]
        fontSize: 12
    }
});
```

Aphrodite will ensure that the global `@font-face` rule for this font is only inserted once, no matter how many times it's referenced.

# Descendant selectors

Descendant rules (i.e. a rule like `.parent:hover .child { ... }` in CSS) are created by adding values to your styles indicating the styles to apply to the child. To distinguish the styles from normal CSS keys, the keys start with a `>>`, like `'>>child'`.

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    someContainer: {
        ":hover": {
            ">>myChild": {
                // Styles to apply to the child when the parent is
                // hovered over.
                color: "red",
                fontWeight: "bold"
            }
        }
    }
});
```

Then, apply the `someContainer` style using `css(styles.someContainer)`, and add the child's style to a descendant of the parent using `css(styles.someContainer.myChild)`, where `myChild` is the name of the key you used, without the `>>`.

For example, using React's jsx syntax:

```jsx
<div className={css(styles.someContainer, ...)}>
    <div className={css(styles.someContainer.myChild, ...)}>
        This turns red and bold when the parent is hovered over
    </div>
</div>
```

This will generate CSS that looks like:
```css
.someContainer_xxx:hover .myChild_xxx {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

# Caveats

## Assigning a string to a content property for a pseudo-element

When assigning a string to the `content` property it requires double or single quotes in CSS.
Therefore with Aphrodite you also have to provide the quotes within the value string for `content` to match how it will be represented in CSS.

As an example:

```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  large: {
      ':after': {
        content: '"Aphrodite"',
      },
    },
  },
  small: {
      ':before': {
        content: "'Aphrodite'",
      },
    },
  });
```
The generated css will be:

```css
  .large_im3wl1:after {
      content: "Aphrodite" !important;
  }

  .small_ffd5jf:after {
      content: 'Aphrodite' !important;
  }
```

# Tools

- [Aphrodite output tool](https://output.jsbin.com/qoseye) - Paste what you pass to `StyleSheet.create` and see the generated CSS

# TODO

- Optional AST transformation to replace StyleSheet.create with an object
  literal.
- Add Flow annotations
- Add JSdoc
- Enable ESlint
- Consider removing !important from everything.
